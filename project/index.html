  <div id="LayoutDiv1">For years my family and friends have enjoyed my homemade salad dressings, dips and marinades.  They urged me to market my creations for everyone’s enjoyment.  I’ve created POP-POP’S BEST for exactly this purpose.

Now you can enjoy POP-POP’S BEST in your own home!

My NEW Balsamic Gourmet Vinaigrette will dazzle your taste buds with a unique combination of flavors, sweetness and a little zing.  This amazing Balsamic dressing easily doubles as a fine marinade for meats and vegetables.

Enjoy it and please use the Guest Book to tell your story and let others know how you liked it!
